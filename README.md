# Liver Patient Classifier

This project aims to predict liver disease in patients through a classification task, encompassing various stages from data preprocessing to model deployment. The repository contains code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model creation, model tuning, and model deployment using FastAPI and Streamlit.

## Business Case

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a significant health concern worldwide, leading to liver failure if left untreated. This project addresses the need for accurate prediction algorithms to alleviate the burden on healthcare professionals. The dataset comprises 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India.

## Market Research

Liver diseases, including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), are emerging as major health issues in India due to lifestyle changes. Liver disease affects one in five Indians and is a leading cause of mortality, surpassing diabetes and road accidents. Early detection through predictive models can significantly impact patient outcomes.

## Domain Analysis

The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total proteins, albumin, albumin and globulin ratio, and the target variable indicating liver disease presence.

## Conclusion

Five machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine (classifier), K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision tree, and Random forest, were evaluated for liver disease prediction. The K-Nearest Neighbour and Decision tree (tuned) models demonstrated promising results. Future enhancements may involve incorporating genetic data and deeper learning methods for improved predictions.

## Challenges Faced

- Understanding the dataset
- Exploring abbreviations and special characters
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

This project contributes to the advancement of liver disease prediction models and underscores the importance of leveraging data science in healthcare for proactive disease management.
